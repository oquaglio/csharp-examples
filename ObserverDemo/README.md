# ObserverDemo

No external NuGet packages or third-party libraries are used here—it's all built with the core .NET runtime and standard namespaces:

- System: Handles basic types (e.g., string, Console for output).
- System.Collections.Generic: Provides the List<IObserver> for managing subscribers.
